# spark-scalatest-helper
This is a small library to help us write some nicer test with spark, it is heavily inspired by [spark-testing-base](https://github.com/holdenk/spark-testing-base), just less extensive so it will just fit what we need.

The tests are a (very) basic example of the testing flow we want.
